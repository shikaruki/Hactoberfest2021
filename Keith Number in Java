##Output:

Yes, the given number is a Keith number.
Yes, the given number is a Keith number.
No, the given number is not a Keith number.

#Define:
A positive n digit number X is called a Keith number (or repfigit number) if it is arranged in a special number sequence generated using its digits. The special sequence has first n terms as digits of x and other terms are recursively evaluated as the sum of previous n terms. For example, 197, 19, 742, 1537, etc.

Keith Number Example
Let's check the number 742 is a Keith number or not.

First, we will separate each digit, as 7, 4, 2
To find the next term of the above-created series, we add these digits (i.e. 7+4+2), and the resultant (13) that we get becomes the next term of the series.

Now, the series becomes, 7, 4, 2, 13

To find the next term of the above series, we add the last three terms (i.e. 13+2+4), and the resultant (19) that we get becomes the next term of the series.

Now, the series becomes, 7, 4, 2, 13, 19

To find the next term of the above series, we add the last three terms (i.e. 19+13+2), and the resultant (34) that we get becomes the next term of the series.

Now, the series becomes, 7, 4, 2, 13, 19, 34

To find the next term of the above series, we add the last three terms (i.e. 34+19+13), and the resultant (66) that we get becomes the next term of the series.

Now, the series becomes, 7, 4, 2, 13, 19, 34, 66
Now, the series becomes, 7, 4, 2, 13, 19, 34, 66, 119, 219, 404

To find the next term of the above series, we add the last three terms (i.e. 404+219+119), and the resultant (742) that we get becomes the next term of the series.

Now, the series becomes, 7, 4, 2, 13, 19, 34, 66, 119, 219, 404, 742
Here, we will stop the process because we get the same number (742) as a term of the series. Hence, the given number 742 is a Keith number.
